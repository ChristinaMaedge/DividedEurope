# Divided Europe? - Analysis about the differences between European countries (Clustering and PCA)

Sixteen years after the EU east enlargement there are still discussions about a “two-class Europe”. Still, we can find articles about the “grubby kids” from the Eastern Europe and still, there are many prejudices: Crime is higher in Eastern Europe. In Eastern European countries, democracy and its institutions would be undermined. The social system is still considered to be expandable more than a quarter of a century after the end of Soviet rule. The gap between rich and poor is wide apart. In brief, the former soviet states have still not made it to Europe.

These prejudices that still exist, led me to some questions:
1. Are all these prejudices true? Is there really a divided Europe? A two-class Europe, a Europe divided into east and west?

2. If it is true, what are the indicators / factors that make up this division respectively led to this division or maintain it? What are the differences between European countries based on? Are there overriding factors, that is, can we combine sub-factors to a major one? Can we transform variables from higher dimensions into a 1, 2 or 3-dimensional space?

I answered these questions using clustering and PCA.
